        HISTORY: <br><br>
        <span style="font-size:20px;">
            Haas Formula LLC, competing as MoneyGram Haas F1 Team, is an American-licensed Formula One racing team established by NASCAR Cup Series team co-owner Gene Haas in April 2014. The team originally intended to make its debut at the start of the 2015 season but later elected to postpone their entry until the 2016 season. The team principal is Guenther Steiner.

Haas is the first American team to compete in Formula One since the Haas Lola outfit raced in the 1985 and 1986 seasons. The team is based in Kannapolis, North Carolina, United States – 31 mi (50 km) from Charlotte – alongside sister team and NASCAR entrant Stewart-Haas Racing, though the two teams are separate entities.

Haas' first race was the 2016 Australian Grand Prix, where Romain Grosjean finished in ninth place.
The team finished the season in ninth place in the Constructors' Championship.

In 2017, Haas improved their performance, finishing in fifth place in the Constructors' Championship.
The team scored their first podium finish at the Austrian Grand Prix, where Grosjean finished in second place.
                
In 2018, Haas struggled with reliability issues, and finished in sixth place in the Constructors' Championship.
                
In 2019, Haas continued to struggle, and finished in ninth place in the Constructors' Championship.
                
In 2020, Haas had a better season, finishing in seventh place in the Constructors' Championship.
The team scored their second podium finish at the Turkish Grand Prix, where Kevin Magnussen finished in third place.
                
In 2021, Haas struggled again, finishing in last place in the Constructors' Championship. The team scored no podiums and only one point,
which was scored by Mick Schumacher at the British Grand Prix.
                
In 2022, Haas has improved their performance, and are currently in seventh place in the Constructors' Championship.
The team has scored two points, which were scored by Kevin Magnussen at the Bahrain Grand Prix and the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.
                
Haas is a young team with a lot of potential. The team has a strong driver line-up in Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hulkenberg, and a dedicated team of engineers and mechanics.
With continued investment from Gene Haas, Haas has the potential to be a regular points scorer and race winner in the years to come.
