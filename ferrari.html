        In the 1970s, Ferrari went through a period of decline, but the team returned to form in the 1980s with Drivers'

        2000s, when the team won five consecutive Constructors' Championships and four consecutive Drivers'
        Championships with Michael Schumacher.

        Since Schumacher's retirement in 2006, Ferrari has not won a Drivers' Championship, but the team has remained
