        HISTORY: <br><br>
        <span style="font-size:20px;">
            McLaren is one of the most successful Formula One teams in history, having won 183 races, 12 Drivers' Championships, and 8 Constructors' Championships. The team was founded in 1963 by New Zealander Bruce McLaren, and has been competing in Formula One ever since.

McLaren's early years were marked by success in Can-Am, a popular open-wheel racing series in North America. The team won the Can-Am championship four times in a row from 1967 to 1970. In Formula One, McLaren's first victory came in 1968, with Denny Hulme winning the Belgian Grand Prix. The team won its first Drivers' Championship in 1974, with Emerson Fittipaldi, and its first Constructors' Championship in the same year.

In the 1980s, McLaren entered a period of dominance in Formula One. The team won the Drivers' Championship with Alain Prost in 1985 and 1986, and with Ayrton Senna in 1988 and 1990. McLaren also won the Constructors' Championship in all four of those years.

In the 1990s, McLaren continued to be a competitive force in Formula One. The team won the Drivers' Championship with Mika Häkkinen in 1998 and 1999, and the Constructors' Championship in 1998.

In recent years, McLaren has not been as successful as it was in the past. The team has not won a Drivers' Championship since 2008, or a Constructors' Championship since 2008. However, McLaren remains one of the most respected teams in Formula One, and is always a contender for race wins and championships.
