        HISTORY: <br><br>
        <span style="font-size:20px;">
            Aston Martin first entered Formula One in 1959 with the DBR4, their first open-wheel racing car. The DBR4
            was first built and tested in 1957 but did not make its Formula One debut until 1959. This delay was caused
            by the company prioritising the development of the DBR1 sports car, which went on to win the 1959 24 Hours
            of Le Mans. By the DBR4's world championship debut at the Dutch Grand Prix, it had become outdated and
            struggled for pace against its competitors, with Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori qualifying 10th and 13th
            respectively out of 15.

            Aston Martin competed in Formula One for two more seasons, in 1960 and 1961, but failed to score any points.
            The team withdrew from Formula One at the end of the 1961 season.

            In 2021, Aston Martin returned to Formula One as a works team, with Lawrence Stroll's Racing Point team
            rebranded as Aston Martin. The team finished seventh in the Constructors' Championship in their debut
            season.

            In 2022, Aston Martin finished sixth in the Constructors' Championship. The team's drivers, Lance Stroll and
            Sebastian Vettel, scored a combined total of 77 points.

            Aston Martin is a well-respected name in motorsport, and their return to Formula One has been met with
            excitement by fans. The team has the potential to be successful in the years to come, and they will be
            looking to challenge for podiums and race wins in the near future.
