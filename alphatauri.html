        HISTORY: <br><br>
        <span style="font-size:20px;">
            AlphaTauri is an Italian Formula One racing team and constructor, owned by Austrian beverage company Red Bull. It is one of two Formula One constructors owned by Red Bull, the other being Red Bull Racing. The constructor was rebranded for the 2020 Formula One World Championship from "Toro Rosso" to "AlphaTauri" in order to promote the AlphaTauri fashion brand. According to Franz Tost and Helmut Marko, Scuderia AlphaTauri is no longer the junior team but the sister team to Red Bull Racing.

            <pre style="font-size:20px;background-color:rgba(0, 0, 139, 0.527);color:white;">

The team's history can be traced back to 1985, when Minardi entered Formula One. The team was bought by Red Bull in 2005 and rebranded as Toro Rosso in 2006.
Toro Rosso was originally intended to be a "junior" team to Red Bull Racing, giving young drivers a chance to race in Formula One before being promoted to the senior team.

Toro Rosso had some success in its early years, scoring its first podium finish in 2008 with Sebastian Vettel. However, the team struggled in the early 2010s,
and did not score a podium finish between 2011 and 2015.
                
Toro Rosso's fortunes began to improve in 2016, with Daniil Kvyat scoring the team's first race win in 2015. The team continued to improve in the 2017 and 2018 seasons,
scoring a number of podium finishes and finishing fourth in the Constructors' Championship in 2019.
                
In 2020, Toro Rosso was rebranded as AlphaTauri, in order to promote Red Bull's fashion brand. The team continued to perform well in 2020, scoring a win with Pierre Gasly
at the Italian Grand Prix. AlphaTauri finished the season in seventh place in the Constructors' Championship.
                
In 2021, AlphaTauri continued to perform well, scoring a podium finish with Pierre Gasly at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.
The team finished the season in sixth place in the Constructors' Championship.
                
AlphaTauri is a young team with a lot of potential. The team has a strong driver line-up in Nyck De Vries and Yuki Tsunoda, and a dedicated team of engineers and mechanics. With continued investment from Red Bull, AlphaTauri has the potential to be a regular podium finisher and race winner in the years to come.
                

Here are some of the team's most notable achievements:
                
    &#x2022;Won the Italian Grand Prix in 2020 (Pierre Gasly)

    &#x2022;Finished fourth in the Constructors' Championship in 2019

    &#x2022;Scored 10 podium finishes

    &#x2022;Pole positions: 1

    &#x2022;Fastest laps: 1
    

The AlphaTauri team is a team with a bright future. With a strong driver line-up and a dedicated team, the team is capable of achieving great things in the years to come.
